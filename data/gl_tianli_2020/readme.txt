The ICESat-2-derived grounding zone features of the Antarctica Ice Sheet between 30 March 2019 and 30 September 2020 are provided as three separate .csv files:

1- ‘ICESat2_F.csv’ for landward limit of tidal flexure 
2- ‘ICESat2_H.csv’ for inshore limit of hydrostatic equilibrium 
3- ‘ICESat2_I.csv’ for break-in-slope

The attributes of the data files are:

lat: latitude of the grounding zone feature (unit: decimal degree)
lon: longitude of the grounding zone feature (unit: decimal degree)
track: reference ground track number
beam_pair: ICESat-2 beam pair number
beam: ‘l’, ‘r’, ‘pair’ denote if the grounding zone feature is calculated from left-beam repeat-track data group, right-beam repeat-track data group, or beam-pair repeat-track data group
repeat_cycles_no: number of repeat cycles used in grounding zone calculation 
tide_range: the ocean tidal range at the inshore limit of hydrostatic equilibrium from the elevation anomalies of ICESat-2 repeat tracks (unit: meter)
